'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;sigsegv_handler(5);'



Seriously my first buffer overflow.. 


So heres what I did. Just analyzed vuln.c 

what it does is it takes an argument, copies it over to a 16 character buffer. so the arguement I submitted is above.

What that does it stores the 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa; in the buffer.. Then in memory that sigsegv_handler(5); is executed which prints out the flag
