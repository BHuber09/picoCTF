Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. Maybe they can be used to get a password to the process. Connect with nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 38860. Files can be found here: passwd shadow.


hint: try try again
hint: rockyou.



JohnTheRipper: Able to take the shadow and passwd file and can 'unshadow' it for us. Then it stores it in a format that john can read..

then just run

./john output_from_above.txt

and it'll output the password.

nc to the server username root and password to log in and flag it the output.
